# Licensing FAQ

## Is internal SaaS infrastructure considered internal use?
No. If the infrastructure supports a revenue-generating service,
it is considered commercial use.

## What if customers never see the node?
Visibility is irrelevant. Revenue enablement constitutes commercial use.

## What if we are a startup?
Startups are commercial entities and require a commercial license.

## What if we only use one workflow?
Scope does not change license requirements.

## Do proof-of-concepts require a license?
Internal, non-customer-facing POCs are permitted.
Production SaaS deployments require a license.

## Can I modify the code?
Yes. You may modify the code for personal, educational, research, or
internal business use. Commercial use of modified code still requires
a commercial license.

## What happens after the Change Date?
On January 1, 2030, this code will become available under the Apache
License, Version 2.0, allowing unrestricted commercial use.
